## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_client.models.sensor_all_of_description import SensorAllOfDescription

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of SensorAllOfDescription from a JSON string
sensor_all_of_description_instance = SensorAllOfDescription.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print SensorAllOfDescription.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
sensor_all_of_description_dict = sensor_all_of_description_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of SensorAllOfDescription from a dict
sensor_all_of_description_form_dict = sensor_all_of_description.from_dict(sensor_all_of_description_dict)
